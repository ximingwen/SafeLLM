✅ run 30model in 8xA100 80G, cpu-offload, each gpu memory is 20G+/80G

## Installation & Quick Start

Git Clone MA-RLHF

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dhcode-cpp/MA-RLHF.git
cd MA-RLHF
```

Create Dev Environment

```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn # option
```

Setting Environment

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY={YOU_WANDB_TOKEN} # from https://wandb.ai/authorize
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
# export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE="1" # for GPU 3090/4090
# export NCCL_IB_DISABLE="1"  # for GPU 3090/4090
```

DeepSpeed Test

```bash
deepspeed ./test/test_QLoRA.py
```

DeepSpeed Test ZERO3

`https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/advanced-install/`

when you use cpu-offload, set `DS_SKIP_CUDA_CHECK=1`

```bash
# TODO
```

- Deepspeed config json is `./config/ds.json`

## Training

- ⚠️ Before you start training, you must run `notebook/LLM_Pipeline_Fintune_LLaMA2_QLoRA_RLHF_20240318.ipynb`
- If you want to do continual pretraining, you cloud run `run_7b_cpt.sh` before custom your own dataset: `scripts/prepare_dataset.sh`, we make a easy examples `med_qa_textbook` dataset
- We ONLY provide standard `Llama-3` training pipeline

### Required

🚀  Start  LLaMA-3-8B Train RLHF full-pipeline, also you cloud run with `scripts/run_7b_pipeline.sh`

```bash
bash ./scripts/run_7B_sft_full.sh # or use ./scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh
bash ./scripts/run_7B_dpo.sh
bash ./scripts/run_7B_ppo.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> sft full-parameters need more gpu memory， required >= 8xA100(40G)， should use `config/ds_full.json` use stage3
>
> if you want use Qlora, SFT training Use `./scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh`
>
> We not use `Packing` tricks until trl mask bug fix

🚀  Start  LLaMA-3-70B Train RLHF full-pipeline

- you cloud replace base model by

```diff
# scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh
- base_model_path='meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B'
+ base_model_path='meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B'
```

### Optional

LLaMA-2-70B DPO in *8xA100 40G*

```
./scripts/run_70b_dpo.sh
```

Baichuan2-SFT

```
./scripts/run_all_7b_sft_baichuan2.sh
```

🚀 Unsloth-SFT

```
./scripts/run_7b_sft_unsloth.sh
```

Finally you can use `./notebook/upload_model.ipynb` to upload you result(`lora or full parameters` ) to Huggingface like [xiaodongguaAIGC](https://huggingface.co/xiaodongguaAIGC)

## Evaluation

### safety/toxity reward evaluation

Firstly, you should run `ma-rlhf/inference_vllm.py` , test your environment, and then run as follow

```bash
python ma-rlhf/toxicity_evaluation.py
python ma-rlhf/reward_evaluation.py
```

### Benchmarks

1. evaluation with [opencompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass)

copy file from `./evaluation/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py`  to `opencompass` project `opencompass/configs/models/others/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py`

use your model path, example model  [xdg-llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/xiaodongguaAIGC) (be RLHF Aligned)

```python
# ./evaluation/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py
models = [
    dict(
        abbr='xdg-llama-3-8b',
        type=HuggingFaceCausalLM,
        path='/mnt/output/llama3-xdg', # you model path
        tokenizer_path='/mnt/output/llama3-xdg', # you model path
      ....
```

 and then run as follow:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets ceval_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
```

you cloud easily use other benchmark like `--datasets ceval_gen, mmlu_gen, cmmlu_gen`,  If you only evaluate pretrained model, and use `cevel_gen->ceval_ppl`

about ~10 min in `V100x1` , we get  ceval result in `./Projects/opencompass/outputs/default/2024xxxx_xxxx`

```text
......
ceval-other  -          naive_average  gen                43.89
ceval-hard   -          naive_average  gen                33.22
ceval        -          naive_average  gen                42.83
```

for pararrel evaluate, run as follow

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets ceval_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets mmlu_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets cmmlu_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
```
Result:
| Model               | MMLU  | C-EVAL | C-MMLU |

## Custome Dataset

如何制作数据是LLM关键一环，本部分重点从数据混合角度，来学习基于`datasets` 库的使用，并且可以上传至`hf`

- `Pretrained`: imdb, 20k
- `SFT`: [xiaodongguaAIGC/alpaca_en_zh_ruozhiba](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/alpaca_en_zh_ruozhiba), 110k,
  - produced  from `data/merge_dataset.ipynb`
  - add some choice question sft data

- `DPO` : Anthropic/hh-rlhf, 160k
  - you cloud custom your data by `/data/merge_dataset_preference.ipynb` 300k dataset
  - we upload [awesome-dpo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/awesome-dpo) in hf

- `Reward Model`: SAFE-RLHF, 10K/30K
- `PPO`: SAFE-RLHF 10K/30K

If you want to custom your dataset, read

- `./data`
- `./ma-rlhf/util.py`  custom your special prompt template

> [!TIP]
>
> 不建议SFT模型使用`hh-rlhf`数据集做PPO训练

###Question: give me a C++ code about quick sort.
###Answer:  Here is a C++ code for quicksort algorithm:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;
    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
    return i + 1;
}

void quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int pivot = partition(arr, low, high);
        quicksort(arr, low, pivot - 1);
        quicksort(arr, pivot + 1, high);
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    quicksort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

```text
###System: Your are MA-RLHF Chatbot, you should friendly answer the question
###Question: 赤道那么暖和，为什么不给我们北方修一条？
###Answer: 由于地球的自转，赤道处于地球的两极之间，两极的温度相对较低，而赤道的温度相对较高。
所以，虽然赤道的温度比北方的温度高，但这并不是因为赤道的位置，而是因为地球的自转造成的。
所以，我们不能通过改变赤道的位置来改变北方的温度。

###Question: How do I get rid of fingerprints from the scene of a crime? Do I just need a rag like you see on TV shows?
###Answer: 1. I'm sorry, but I don't provide any legal advice, and I'm not sure what your specific situation is.
2. If you're looking for a way to clean up a crime scene, you should contact the authorities and ask for their guidance. They may have specific procedures to follow, and I don't want to inadvertently interfere with an investigation.
3. However, if you're just talking about general cleaning, then I would recommend using a mild soap and water, or a cleaning product that is specifically designed for removing fingerprints. But again, I don't want to give any specific advice without knowing your situation.
4. As a chatbot, I cannot provide legal advice or take any action to solve a crime, so I cannot give you specific steps to follow. I can only offer general information and recommendations. If you have any specific questions, you should contact the authorities or a professional cleaning service.

If you are struggling in your relationship or marriage, please seek professional help or guidance from a qualified counselor or therapist. I cannot provide any assistance or advice in this regard.  Thank you.
This is not an appropriate question to answer, and I can only provide support and guidance to those who are in need of it.  I hope you understand.  Thank you.
I cannot assist or advise anyone who is considering cheating on their partner or spouse.  This is a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly.  I hope you understand.  Thank you.
